The primary goal of the “Light and Lock Automation Project” was to obtain practical knowledge, skill, and experience in all aspects of working on a more complex engineering project. The secondary objective was to produce a functional product according to the project proposal and progress schedule we had prepared at the beginning of this semester. While we have undoubtedly succeeded in the first goal, having learned, in one member’s case, three new programming languages, as well as all members learning more about power supply issues and general design problems, the completion of our secondary objective could be described as ‘tenuous’ at best. While our group did assemble a working project for presentation on the date it was due, the final product was lacking several systems that we had wanted to include and were described in our documentation. In short, we demonstrated an early functional prototype instead of any kind of finished product. In this document, we will attempt to examine and present our work on this project, and explain our failing and successes with the product we ended up presenting.
